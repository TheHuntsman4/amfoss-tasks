Another fun task. Took me 3 days to complete and it was very fun to do. I've always heard about bots that automate tasks like these. Twitter bots amazon bots and so many more, so I was very excited to work on one. It did have its hard parts, especially getting all the data into a CSV file. It took me a while but I got it in the end. The environment variables were also a hassle.
