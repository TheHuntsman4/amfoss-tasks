One of the harder tasks.  I wasn't sure whether Id can complete it within the given time as there was not a lot of material. But I searched on google a bit more properly and I ended up getting a website with a  tutorial to make a simple calculator.  I got that up and running and I got the output on the console. The linking part was harder, but I eventually figured it out with some help from friends.
