# ðŸš€INTERNET EXPLORERðŸš€
I followed the instructions given in each of the parts-# folders and "completed" the task. A major issue that I faced was although I was able to link the CSS and java files, non of the changes I made in them were reflected in the webpage when I loaded it in the browser. So I was forced to make all the styling and scripts internal using the <style> and <script> tags respectively initially. But after a while, the js file got linked but the CSS file is not connecting. Hence I had to give it within the index.html itself. In the end, I was able to re-create a similar webpage as the one given in the demo link.
