# TASK-08 INTERNET EXPLORER
I followed the instructions given in each of the part-# folders and "completed" the task. A major issue which I faced was although I was able to link the css and java files, non of the changes I made in them were reflectd in the webpage when I loaded it in the browser. So I was forced to make all the styling and scripts internal using the <style> and <script> tags repectively. In the end I was ble to re-create a similar webpage as the one given in the demo link .
