# 🕵️Find the bug 🕵️
Was a very cool task to do. Again I have heard about this client-server thing for a while from school and friends. Although not as difficult as I first thought it was still a very good experience. But it is lying if I didn't face any problems while doing the task. First of all, I had a hard time understanding what was going on the code didn't make a  lot of sense and I was forced to go in blind. I did 90% of the task in under 3 hours after figuring out some basic stuff but I got stuck again in generating a JSON file. I asked a senior and he pointed out that I should make sure all my function calls have been done properly. Although I didn't get it straight away after I reached my room I realized I hadn't put in StreamWriter. I think I must've accidentally deleted while I was running each part of the code while debugging another issue
