# Find the bug üïµÔ∏è
### Problem Statement
- We all know about servers and know how it works, some of us might be curious about them. Making server-based applications are not a big task if we find a nice and good article. You might even have thought of making one someday. \
What if we say that you can make a client-server-based CLI application using C#? Yes, We have provided you with a client server-based application using Microsoft's framework, .NET, which is based on C#. The application provided to you actually sends some data from the client to the server, which will be stored in a JSON file. We have provided you with the source code for these which has some errors :bug:. Try to solve the bugs and complete the client-server application.

### :thinking: What To & How To
- Here as we are testing the application, we will be running both the server and client on the same device.
- You have to just debug both server-side and client-side code using your favourite IDE such that you are able to successfully run it in on your system and make them communicate(in your system itself)
  -  :bulb: Keep an eye on the comments in the code to get a better idea of where the bugs might be. 
- Open both client and server directories separately and run it using the `dotnet run` command.
- Note: you should run the server first and then the client, otherwise client won't be able to communicate to the server.

### :star_struck: Bonus
These are optional tasks you can take up, only if you are interested and you have implemented the basic functionalities
- If your OS is Windows, you can also try adding GUI to the application using Visual Code
- You can add any extra features to the application like asking for any other extra date, etc. It can be anything provided your app runs.
