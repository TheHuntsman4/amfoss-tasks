# :hammer_and_wrench:TERMINAL HUNT:hammer_and_wrench:
I enjoyed this task. The first 3 steps were easy as hell, but I ran into problems when the second half asked me to "push" my progress to my GitHub account. I did not know what that was and I sat on it for a while coz I didn't want to mess anything up by doing something I didn't know. Then I decided to just look up what to do and then I realized it was super easy and quick. Coming back to this Task after I've done a lot of the other tasks I seriously am grateful for this one as it allowed me to understand basic terminal commands just as the task readme said :joy::joy:. And in retrospect, this task is which eased me in on googling, because since school we've been taught not to look up anything on google and even though the rules for the tasks explicitly ask us to google I was not sure what it meant.
