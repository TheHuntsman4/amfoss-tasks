# :hammer_and_wrench:TERMINAL HUNT:hammer_and_wrench:\
I really enjoyed this task. The first 3 steps were easy as hell, but i ran into problems when the second half asked me to "push" my progress to my github account. I did not know what that was and i sat on it for a while coz I didnt want to mess anything up by doing something i didnt know. Then i decided to just look up what to do and then i realised it was super easy and quick. Coming back to this Task after ive done a lot of the other tasks i seriously am grateful for this one as it allowed me to understand basic terminal commannds just as the task readme said :joy::joy:joy:. And in retrospect this task is which eased me in on googling , because sinnce school we've been taught to not look  up anythng on google and even though the rules for the tasks explicitly asks us to google i was not sure what it meant.
