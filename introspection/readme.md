# INTROSPECTION
## WHY MUST YOU CHOSE ME ?
I've known coding for a while, and I've always liked solving problems but I couldnt complete some always, but I never stopped trying to grow better.What drives me even  more  is the need to learn how 
something or anything works.We as a species generate an unfathomable amount of data every second, yet today's technology is able to interpret and use it effectively.I think amfoss will give me an opportunity 
to understand the world we live in today. I believe that I've got what it takes and i belive that taking me in will benefit amfoss and I personally believe that seeing my curiosity and drive to learn amfoss can choose me to be a part of it.
## WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
Becoming better at coding in general. I realised I was still lacking whilst doing the hackerrank task and I wish to learn how to problem solve more and imporve myself . Also tasks like
building my own telegram bot and web scrapping really made me realise how vast computer science is and how  it touches each and every area of life today. I want to explore all of those facets and i want learn 
about them.
## HOW WOULD YOU CONTIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will do my maximum and to the best of my abilities to aid and help the club and its members with anything.Even if it just helpinng with some event or doing a project, I am ready to give my blood and sweat.
## DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
I found some of the tasks hard, but that is what I expected and the tasks stellarly delivered the reason why this club is one of the best student clubs in the nation.I learnt a lot of new things in just a month and  that too in different fields and  different languages.From making a simple mobile app to client-server and web scrapping, it has ben fun as much as it has been infuriating sometimes. I found the whole  procedure to be perfect.
