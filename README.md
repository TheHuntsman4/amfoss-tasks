# INTROSPECTION
## WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
I've known to code for a while, and I've always liked solving problems I couldn't complete some, but I never stopped trying to grow better. What drives me, even more, is the need to learn how something or anything works. We as a species generate an unfathomable amount of data every second, yet today's technology can interpret and use it effectively. I think amfoss will allow me to understand the world we live in today. I believe that I've got what it takes and I believe that taking me in will benefit amfoss I believe that seeing my curiosity and drive to learn amfoss can choose me to be a part of it.
## WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
Becoming better at coding in general. I realized I was still lacking while doing the hackerrank task and wish to learn how to solve problems more and improve myself. Also, tasks like
building my telegram bot and web scrapping made me realize how vast computer science is and how it touches every area of life today. I want to explore all of those facets and I want to learn 
about them.
## HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I will do my maximum and to the best of my abilities to aid and help the club and its members with anything. Even if it is just helping with some event or doing a project, I am ready to give my blood and sweat.
## DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
I found some of the tasks hard, but that is what I expected, and the tasks were stellarly delivered the reason why this club is one of the best student clubs in the nation. I learned a lot of new things in just a month and that too in different fields and different languages. From making a simple mobile app to client-server and web scrapping, it has been fun as much as it has been infuriating sometimes. I found the whole procedure to be perfect.
